    <p>Latest News: Cristiano Ronaldo Scores 900th Goal
        It’s up for debate if Cristiano Ronaldo is the GOAT of professional soccer, but one thing is certain: He’s the most prolific scorer in the sport’s history.
        
        The 39-year-old scored in the 34th minute of Portugal’s UEFA Nations League Victory over Croatia on September 5, becoming the first men’s player to reach 900 career goals. “It was emotional because it’s a milestone,” Ronaldo said, according to the Associated Press. “It seems like any other milestone, but only I know, and the people around me, how hard it is to work every day, to be physically and psychologically fit, to score 900 goals. It’s a unique milestone in my career.”
        
        Ronaldo moved 58 goals ahead of Argentinian star Lionel Messi, who’s in second place with 842 career goals. Late Brazilian legend Pelé is third all-time with 765. Ronaldo has previously said he hopes to reach 1,000 goals before ending his illustrious career.</p>
